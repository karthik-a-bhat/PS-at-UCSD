# Section 2: Internship Preparation
Before you even start to apply to Product Management Positions, you should be sure to have a solid idea of what exactly you are applying to. In the previous section you learned the basics, but now it's time to become competitive. 

## Resume
- Cover Letter
  - Unless you're applying to Bain or McKinsey, chances are you do not need a cover letter. A few companies may ask you to write a few short sentences about their product, but a cover letter is often a waste of time.
- One Page of Goodness (General Resume Tips)
  - One page, fill the page
  - 3-5 bullets per position -> formula: Verb ___ because/to ___ insight. Make sure to use metrics (numbers) where applicable
  - Include relevant PM technologies: Jira, Tableau, SQL, Agile, Scrum, SDLC, etc.
  - Emphasize Product Management and Leadership
  - Example resume and template [here](https://github.com/kgillasp/Resume/blob/master/README.md)
- LinkedIn - The Online Resume
  - Use your profile to tell a narrative. Why have your experiences shaped you to become a PM? If they haven't... craft a compelling narrative!
  - Keep your industry in mind: Silicon Valley? Let your personality shine through. Wall Street? Maybe wear a suit.
  - Highlight **Leadership** and **Initiative**
  - Do not repeat your resume in your experience descriptions. You have more room -- use it!
  - Do not be afraid to copy -- check out our example [LinkedIn Profiles](#using-social-media)
- Personal Website (optional)
  - Creating a personal website is a great way to showcase your work and build your personal brand
  - Consider making a website if you feel your resume and LinkedIn do not tell the whole story

# Section 3: The Recruitment Process
Now that you have a thorough knowledge of what being a Product Manager is all about, it's time to apply to positions.

[Not all Product Management Internships require a CS degree](https://swipetounlock.com/joblist)!! PM Internships are all titled similarly, but they may have very different responsibilities from company to company. Make sure to read the job description and keep in mind the difference between Product, Program, and Project Management.

## PM Internship Timeline
Do not wait. Product Manager Internships are often flooded with applicants within a few days. Google and Facebook limit their applicants, and LinkedIn did not even look at outside applications this past year. You can expect Internships to open beginning in July with the Financial companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Followed closely by the major tech companies starting at the beginning of August and closing around the end of the year.

## Finding Internships
First and foremost -- believe in yourself. With time and dedication, getting a PM internship is possible. With this being said, make sure to **start early and start often.** Here are some tips and tricks to find PM Internships.
  - Attend Career Fairs
    - Talk to everyone, not only is it good practice, but often times positions are reserved for only those who ask
    - A personal connection is much more powerful than an online impression
  - Utilize Job Websites
    - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
    - [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm)
    - [Handshake](https://www.joinhandshake.com/)
    - [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
    - [Jumpstart](https://jumpstart.me/)
    - [WayUp](https://www.wayup.com/member/jobs-listing)
    - [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs)
    - [Jobbio](https://jobbio.com/)
    - [RippleMatch](https://ripplematch.com/)
    - [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/)
  - Make sure to search the following keywords, as SEO will return various results
    - "Product Manager Intern"
    - "Product Management Intern"
    - "Associate Product Manager Intern"
    - "Associate Product Management Intern"
    - "Program Manager Intern"
    - "Project Management Intern"
  - Take advantage of job alerts, set up weekly or daily emails with new jobs matching keywords
  - Use referrals, a list of PS Board Members offering referrals will be made available in *June*
  - Follow recruiters on LinkedIn (not "connect", "follow")
  
## APM vs PM
A few established and elite companies have instituted APM (Associate Product Manager) Programs. These programs are extremely competitive and often attract the best and brightest undergraduate students. They are typically small cohorts (6-10 students per year), emphasize Product Management and Leadership, and last 1.5-2 years. Product Management Internships are typically more plentiful and have the potential to be *slightly* less competitive -- but this depends a lot on the company. They depend much more on your assigned team as well as the structure of the company that is employing you. Between the two, there is no concrete advantage to either. A Product Management Internship is really what you make of it. The more initiative and passion you put into your product, the more your manager will help you out.
