# Section 2: Internship Prep
[Not all Product Management Internships require a CS degree](https://swipetounlock.com/joblist)!! PM Internships are all titled similarly, but they may have very different responsibilities from company to company Make sure to read the job description and keep in mind the difference between Product, Program, and Project Management.

## Product Management PM Internship Timeline
Do not wait. Product Manager Internships are often flooded with applicants within a few days. Google and Facebook limit their applicants, and LinkedIn did not even look at outside applications this past year. You can expect Internships to open beginnning in July with the Financial companies like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Followed closesly at the beginning of August, closing around the end of the year.

## APM vs PM
A few established and elite companies have instituted APM (Associate Product Manager) Programs. These programs are extremely competitive and often attract the best and brightest undergrauate students. They are typically small cohorts (6-10 students per year), emphasize Product Management and Leadership, and last 1.5-2 years. Product Management Internships are typically more plentiful and have the potential to be *slightly* less competitive -- but this depends a lot on the company. They depend much more on your assigned team as well as the structure of the company that is employing you. Between the two, there is no concrete advantage to either. A Product Management Internship is really what you make of it. The more initiative and passion you put into your product, the more your manager will help you out.
